This addon was developed as the solution of the screening test for FOSSEE (https://fossee.in/) under Task 1 of the OpenFOAM GUI project selection process. The screening tests were the evaluation step for the FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2025, a summer internship program at IIT Bombay.

🔥 Features of the addon:

**Feature Set 1: Cube Grid Generator**
1. **UI Panel**: A panel named **FOSSEE_ADDON** is added to the 3D Viewport sidebar.
2. **Input Control**: Enter a number **N ∈ [0, 20]** to generate a 2D grid of cubes (each with a side length of 1 Blender unit).
3. **Smart Distribution**: Cubes are evenly distributed in an **m × n** grid without _overlaps_.
4. **Collision Avoidance**: New cubes _do not_ overlap with existing objects in the scene.
5. **Organized Workflow**: Each set of generated cubes is placed in a dedicated collection.
6. **Delete Tool**: A button to delete selected meshes with one click.

**Feature set 2: Mesh Merger**
1. **Merge Button**: Located in the same UI, this button combines selected cubes (generated by the addon) into a single mesh.
2. **Common Face Requirement**: Only meshes sharing at least one common face can be merged.
3. **Auto-Cleanup**: Common vertices are merged into a single vertex, and shared faces are deleted.
