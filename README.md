This addon was developed as the solution of the screening test for FOSSEE (https://fossee.in/) under Task 1 of the OpenFOAM GUI project selection process. The screening tests were the evaluation step for the FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2025, a summer internship program at IIT Bombay.



ðŸ”¥ Features of the addon:

**Feature Set 1: Cube Grid Generator**
1. **UI Panel**: A panel named **FOSSEE_ADDON** is added to the 3D Viewport sidebar.
2. **Input Control**: Enter a number **N âˆˆ [0, 20]** to generate a 2D grid of cubes (each with a side length of 1 Blender unit).
3. **Smart Distribution**: Cubes are evenly distributed in an **m Ã— n** grid without _overlaps_.
4. **Collision Avoidance**: New cubes _do not_ overlap with existing objects in the scene.
5. **Organized Workflow**: Each set of generated cubes is placed in a dedicated collection for easy management.
6. **Delete Tool**: A button to delete selected meshes with one click.

Feature set 2:
1. In the same UI as Feature set 1, there is a button which merges the selected cubes (which were generated using this Add-on) into a single mesh.
2. To be able to merge 2 meshes, they should have at least 1 common face.
3. When merging, the common vertices are merged into a single vertex, and the common face is deleted.
